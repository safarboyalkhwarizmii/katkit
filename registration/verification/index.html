            <p>
                Click on the link in the email to verify your <a href="https://mail.google.com/">email</a> address. This will take you back to the website or
                service where you will be prompted to log in or continue with the account creation process.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In case if you did not received the email, please check your spam or trash folder and if you still not
                received the email please contact the support team of the website/service.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It's important to note that verifying your email address via Gmail is a one-time process and once completed,
                you will not need to verify your email address again unless you update your account information or request a
                password reset.
